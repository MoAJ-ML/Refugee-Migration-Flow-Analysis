UNHCR’s statistical reporting generally follows a methodology that reports only one legal status for each person of concern. However, due to the size of the stateless Rohingya population displaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status of this population group as both displaced and stateless. This approach is being used for Indonesia for the first time in 2019. There are also indications that a potentially sizable population of non-displaced stateless persons exists for whom no data is available."
